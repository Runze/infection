# Infection Project

In this project, per my understanding of the task, I implemented "Total Infection" and "Limited Infection" (including the exact version), and included a test case along with the output graphs. The code, saved in the format of IPython Notebook, can be opened and edited directedly using the Notebook itself or be viewed only using the (nbviewer) [http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/Runze/infection/blob/master/infection.ipynb]. In addition to the code itself, the notebook also includes comments, explanations, and examples about my methodology and understanding.
